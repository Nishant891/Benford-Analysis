C.

The particulars of the proposed variation in the objects for which Prospectus was issued and
alteration/variation in the objects of the Issue as stated above:
The Company intends to vary the terms of the object, by way of deploying and/or utilise the unutilized
amount/balance proceeds of Rs. 1.45 Crores existing object “General Corporate Purpose” towards the
other IPO object of “Acquisition of Land and Construction of Building”.

D. The reason and justification for seeking variation:
The Company had initially planned to acquire land in Wada for the purpose of setting up its new facility
and had accordingly entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). However, due to
unforeseen circumstances, the MoU had to be cancelled. Subsequently, the Company identified and
successfully acquired a more strategically located parcel of land in Palghar.
The location also improves connectivity, access to workforce, and supply chain efficiency. This change
in location, while beneficial for long-term growth and accessibility, has led to an increase in the overall
cost of land and building construction.
In addition, the Palghar location offers a higher Floor Space Index (FSI), which provides an opportunity
to construct a larger facility. In light of this, the Company has revised its construction plans to include
additional space to accommodate future expansion, enhance operational capacity, expand storage
capacity and avoid recurring infrastructure investments. The investment in additional space now will
help reduce duplication of future costs and avoid disruptions during expansion phases.
The shift aligns with the Company’s long-term vision of building scalable and efficient infrastructure.
This forward-looking decision, while increasing the initial capital requirement, is aimed at building
long-term value and operational scalability for the Company.
E.

The proposed time limit within which the proposed varied objects would be achieved;
The Company will utilise the unutilized amount/balance proceeds of Rs. 1.45 Crores towards the object
of “Acquisition of Land and Construction of Building” as per the working capital requirement of the
Company by March, 2026.

G. The risk factors pertaining to the new objects and estimated financial impact of the proposed
alteration on the earnings and cash flow of the company:
The management proposes to use the unutilised proceeds allocated for general corporate purposes
for the object – Acquisition of Land and Construction of Building which will ease the additional burden
on finance plan and internal accruals of the Company. This strategic adjustment underscores the
Company’s commitment to effective financial utilization as it navigates its evolving operational
landscape. Further, considering unforeseen economic, market, reforms in government policy, business
or any other conditions beyond the control of the management, there is no assurance that deployment

17 | P a g e

4th Annual Report 2024-2025
of funds toward the object will be profitable and will help in business growth and expansion of the
Company.
H. The other relevant information which is necessary for the members to take an informed decision on
the proposed resolution:
None. All details are mentioned in the explanatory statement.
The Company shall undertake the corporate action in relation to the variation of Objects mentioned
in item no. 05 of this resolution, only if the aforesaid proposal of variation/deviation/alteration in the
Objects is approved by more than 90% of the present and voting shareholders. Therefore, even if the
special resolution is passed with the requisite majority but 10% or more of the present and voting
shareholders dissent to the variation in the Objects, the Company will not act upon the corporate
action authorized by item no. 05 of the resolution and the Objects will not be varied. Accordingly, the
promoters of the Company will not be required to provide an exit offer to the dissenting shareholders,
even if the special resolution is validly passed.
In terms of provision of section 13 and 27 of the Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder and
applicable provision of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure
Requirements), 2018, the aforesaid proposal of variation of Objects is being placed before the
shareholders at the AGM for their consideration and approval.
All relevant documents including copy of notice, resolution and explanatory statement in relation to
proposed variation of Objects would be made available for inspection. Please refer to Note No. 05
given in the Notice on inspection of documents.

this resolution to the extent of their shareholding in the Company, as they will not provide any exit
offer to the dissenting shareholders.
Except above, none of the other Directors and/or Key Managerial Personnel of the Company including
their relatives are, in any way, concerned or interested, financially or otherwise, in the resolution as
set forth in item no. 05.
The Board recommends the resolution set forth in item no. 05 for approval of the members as a special

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT

OVERVIEW
The Company is in the business of manufacturing of a diverse range of high-quality wires, including Spring Steel
Wire, Galvanized Wire (GI Wire), Round Stitching Wire, Brass Wire, Copper Wire, Stainless Steel Wire, Mild Steel
(M.S.) & Low Carbon Wire, H.B. & H.H.B. Wire, Annealed Wire, Spiral Wires, and Baling Wires. The Company has
also started the manufacturing and trading of Precious Metals like Gold and Silver Wires which in majority caters
to the Gems & Jewelry and other related Industries.
One of the primary forces behind industrialization has been the use of metals. Steel has traditionally occupied a
top spot among metals. Steel production and consumption are frequently seen as measures of a country's
economic development because it is both a raw material and an intermediary product. Therefore, it would not
be an exaggeration to argue that the steel sector has always been at the forefront of industrial progress and that
it is the foundation of any economy.
The wire and cable industry is an essential segment of the electrical equipment industry, supporting
infrastructure, power, construction, automobile, and telecom sectors. The Indian wire market has witnessed
significant growth driven by government initiatives like Make in India, smart cities, and rural electrification.
Increasing industrialization and infrastructure development have also accelerated demand for wires and metal
products.
Packaging currently stands as the fifth largest sector in the Indian economy, reflecting its pivotal role in driving
industrial growth and innovation. With an annual growth rate of 22-25%, the industry has become a preferred
hub for packaging solutions, bolstered by advancements in technology and infrastructure.
India has the largest population in the world in the age bracket of 5-24 years with 580 million people, presenting
a huge opportunity in the education sector. At, the same time India’s auto components industry’s market share
has significantly expanded, led by increasing demand for automobiles by the growing middle class and exports
globally. India has potential to become a global manufacturing hub and by 2030, it can add more than US$ 500
billion annually to the global economy.
Technological advancements are enhancing productivity and quality, while rising export potential offers
opportunities for market expansion. All of the above factors and industries will drive the demand for our Wires
& Wire products including Galvanized wires, M.S. wires, Copper wires, and Steel wire ropes, etc.
INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS
India is the world’s second-largest producer of crude steel, with an output of 125.32 MT of crude steel and
finished steel production of 121.29 MT in FY23.
India’s steel production is estimated to grow 4-7% to 123-127 MT in FY24.
The growth in the Indian steel sector has been driven by the domestic availability of raw materials such as iron
ore and cost-effective labour. Consequently, the steel sector has been a major contributor to India's
manufacturing output.
The Indian steel industry is modern, with state-of-the-art steel mills. It has always strived for continuous
modernisation of older plants and up-gradation to higher energy efficiency levels.

35 | P a g e

4th Annual Report 2024-2025

2008, while domestic steel demand has increased by almost 80%. The capacity for producing steel has grown
concurrently, and the rise has been largely organic.
India has observed a substantial rise in the demand for wires and cables due to the country's ambitious
renewable energy goals and the growing awareness of the potential of renewable energy, such as solar and wind
power. The significant growth of solar panels in India is creating a considerable demand for cables.
While the manufacturing industry growth with Government initiatives like Make In India has accelerated the
pace of ever-growing packaging industry. Similarly, the push by the government of India for Infrastructure
development has increased the demand of Metal wires for construction of roads, bridges, buildings, etc.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid
financial statements give the information required by the Act in the manner so required and give a true and fair
view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of
the Companies Act, 2013. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the
Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India
together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the
provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Other Information
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the
information included in the Board's Report including the Annexure to the Board's Report but does not include
the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with the audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required
to report the fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibility of Management for Financial Statements
The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Companies Act,
2013 ("the Act") with respect to the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of
the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting

irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates
that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial
controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,
relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statement that give a true and fair view and are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

40 | P a g e

4th Annual Report 2024-2025
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no
realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidences
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of integral control.


Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are responsible for
expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in
place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.



Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.



Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report
to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going
concern.



Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in
a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Annexure B referred to in our Report of even date to the members of
Excellent Wires and Packaging Limited
(Formerly known as Excellent Wires and Packaging Limited)
For the year ended March 31, 2025
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act.
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of of Excellent Wires and Packaging
Limited (Formally known as Excellent Wires and Packaging Private Limited) ("The Company") as at March 31,
2025 in conjunction with our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based
on the internal financial control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls
over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets,
the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records,
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting
based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over
Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India ("the ICAI") and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls
and, both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate
internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial
controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial
controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over
financial reporting including obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
A Company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal financial
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that;
1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

48 | P a g e

4th Annual Report 2024-2025
2.

3.

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial
reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliances with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
According to the information and explanation given to us, the Company has, in all material respects, an
adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over
financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the internal control over
financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Balance Sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty
that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be
realized. In situations where the company has unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward tax losses, all
deferred tax assets are recognized only if there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that
they can be realized against future taxable profits. As per the past records and future aspects of the
company, calculation of deferred tax assets/liabilities is not made.

and are determined based on the best estimate required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date.
These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. A
disclosure for a contingent liability is also made in notes when there is a possible obligation or a present
obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources.

Employee Benefit
Gratuity - The Present value of obligation is determined based on actuarial valuation using the
Projected Unit Credit Method. This method considers each period of service as giving rise to an
additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final
obligation.
Interest Cost - It is the increase in the plan liability over the accounting period resulting from
the operation of the actuarial assumption of the interest rate.
Current Service Cost - It is the discounted present value of the benefits from the Plan’s benefit
formula attributable to the services rendered by employees during the accounting period.
Actuarial Gain or Loss - It occurs when the experience of the plan differs from that anticipated
from the actuarial assumptions. It could also occur due to changes made in the actuarial
assumptions.
